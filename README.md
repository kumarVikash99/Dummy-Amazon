# Dummy-Amazon

## Introduction
Dummy-Amazon is a student project designed to clone basic functionalities of the Amazon e-commerce platform. This project aims to demonstrate the use of React for building dynamic and responsive web applications.
I can't publish this project using Firebase because I utilize Firebase Cloud Functions, which require a premium plan for deployment.
